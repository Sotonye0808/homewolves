# Repair System — Error Knowledge Base

> **Overview:** A living knowledge base of errors encountered during development, their root causes, and how they were fixed. Agents should consult this before diagnosing new errors. Every fixed bug should be logged here to prevent recurrence.

## How to Use This File

- **Before debugging:** Search this file for patterns matching your current error
- **After fixing a bug:** Add an entry using the template at the bottom
- **Agents:** Reference this during the fix-build and self-heal cycles

## Error Log

> **Section summary:** Each error entry includes the symptom, cause, fix, and prevention strategy. Entries are added chronologically.

## [Error Title / Short Description]

**Symptom:**
[What the developer or user sees — error message, broken behaviour, etc.]

**Root Cause:**
[The actual technical reason this happened]

**Fix Applied:**
[What change was made to resolve it]

**Prevention:**
[How to avoid this in future — pattern, lint rule, architecture change, etc.]

**Files Affected:**

## Known Error Patterns

> **Section summary:** Recurring error categories seen in this tech stack. Agents should check this section when they match the pattern before investigating further.

### React / Next.js

**Hydration Mismatch**
- Symptom: `Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server`
- Cause: Browser-only logic (window, localStorage, Date.now()) running during server render
- Fix: Wrap in `useEffect` or use `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`
- Prevention: Never access browser APIs outside useEffect in components

**Missing Key Prop**
- Symptom: `Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop`
- Cause: `.map()` rendering without a stable unique key
- Fix: Add `key={item.id}` — use a stable unique ID, not the array index

---

### Design Token / CSS Variable Usage

**Hardcoded Tailwind Color Classes Instead of CSS Variables**
- Symptom: Components use raw Tailwind utilities like `text-emerald-600`, `bg-amber-100`, `text-red-700` etc. instead of `var(--color-status-active)`, `var(--color-warning-bg)`, `var(--color-status-rejected)`
- Cause: Rapid feature development using Tailwind shorthand instead of Homewolves design tokens
- Fix: Replace `className="text-emerald-600"` with inline `style={{ color: 'var(--color-status-active)' }}` or define reusable className utilities
- Prevention: Always use `var(--color-*)` CSS variables for any color. Never use raw Tailwind color names. The token values are defined in `globals.css :root` and support dark/high-contrast themes via `[data-theme]` overrides.

**Missing `@keyframes` for Design Animations**
- Symptom: Design specifies `animation: celebrate-pulse` or similar but component uses generic `animate-pulse`
- Cause: Custom animation keyframes not ported to globals.css
- Fix: Add `@keyframes` block to `globals.css` and reference by name
- Prevention: When implementing a design with custom animations, create a matching `@keyframes` in `globals.css`

---

### Node.js / Backend

**Unhandled Promise Rejection**
- Symptom: Server crashes silently or logs `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning`
- Cause: async function missing try/catch, or `.catch()` not attached to promise
- Fix: Wrap async route handlers in try/catch, use an async error middleware
- Prevention: Always use a global async error wrapper for Express routes

**Database Connection Pool Exhausted**
- Symptom: Requests hang indefinitely under load
- Cause: Connection pool limit too low or connections not being released
- Fix: Increase pool size in config, ensure `client.release()` in finally blocks
- Prevention: Always release DB connections in finally, not just success path

---

### Configuration / Environment

**Missing Environment Variable**
- Symptom: `undefined` values in production, features silently broken
- Cause: Variable defined in `.env.local` but not in production environment
- Fix: Add to deployment environment variables and validate on startup
- Prevention: Add a startup validation check that throws if required env vars are missing
