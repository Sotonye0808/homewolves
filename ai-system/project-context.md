> **Overview:** Homewolves is a multi-sided PropTech marketplace, agent CRM, and transaction management platform for the African real estate market. It connects property buyers, renters, agents, developers, and homeowners in a single operating system — from property discovery through to deal close. The platform is Nigeria-first with a pan-African expansion roadmap.

---

## Project Purpose

African real estate suffers from fragmentation, mistrust, and manual workflows. Agents lose deals on WhatsApp. Buyers cannot verify listings. Transactions have no paper trail. Homewolves fixes this with a single platform covering the entire lifecycle — discovery, verification, client management, and auditable deal execution.

## Target Users

| User Type | Needs | Key Interactions |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Guest/Buyer | Browse properties, search/filter, save favourites, contact agents | Property feed, detail page, wishlist, enquiry form, client dashboard |
| Agent | List properties, manage clients, schedule inspections, close deals | Agent dashboard, CRM, listing manager, transaction workflow |
| Developer | Portfolio management, bulk listings, analytics | Developer dashboard, listing manager, analytics |
| Homeowner | List individual properties, manage enquiries | Listing creation, enquiry inbox |
| Admin | Moderate listings, manage users, configure platform, view audit logs | Admin panel, config panel, audit log viewer, payment review |

---

## Business Constraints

- **Metadata-driven rendering** — all UI labels, icons, options, and feature gates must come from PlatformConfig, not hardcoded sources. Not optional.
- **Audit by default** — every mutation must emit an AuditEvent. No exceptions.
- **Mobile-first** — all layouts must work at 375px width minimum. Desktop is an enhancement.
- **RBAC everywhere** — every protected action checks user permissions against the role matrix, not hardcoded role strings.
- **Nigeria data compliance (NDPR)** — data must reside in Nigerian region; privacy policy enforced at onboarding.
- **Global TypeScript types** — shared types live in `packages/types`, zero-import via triple-slash refs.

## Current Project Phase

Phase: Active Development

Active sprint focus: Phase 1 (Marketplace MVP) is feature-complete through Sprint 3 — transactions, payments, activity points, moderation, and blog. Next focus is performance/SEO/security hardening, testing, and remaining Backlog items (WhatsApp, analytics, PWA).

Current state: `apps/web` and `packages/api` fully scaffolded and building. All features typecheck clean (`tsc --noEmit`). Design HTML exports live in `ai-system/designs/`.

## Tech Decisions Already Made

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Next.js 14 App Router for web | SSR/SSG for SEO, RSC for performance |
| NestJS for backend | OOP-native, decorators, modular, DI — aligns with domain model architecture |
| Prisma ORM | Type-safe schema, migrations, powerful relation queries |
| REST for API | Public-facing API consumed by web + mobile clients |
| PostgreSQL 16 + JSONB | JSONB for metadata fields without schema migration |
| shadcn/ui wrappers (Hw* pattern) | Single point of change for design tokens; prevents direct Radix imports |
| Global TypeScript types (packages/types) | Zero-import types across entire monorepo via triple-slash refs |
| PlatformConfig for all configuration | Admin-controlled UI without code deploys |
| Redis for cache + session + pub/sub | Multi-purpose; simplifies infrastructure |
| Turborepo monorepo | Shared packages, efficient builds, consistent tooling |
| Monochrome + amber palette | Inspired by JamesEdition; warm accent for African market identity |
| Glassmorphism + bento grid | Modern luxury feel; differentiates from flat-card competitors |
| Socket.io for real-time (messaging + notifications) | Single /ws namespace, in-app dispatch |

---

## Out of Scope

- Native iOS/Android apps outside Expo managed workflow
- AI-powered features (chatbot, recommendations, lead scoring) — Phase 5
- Meilisearch / dedicated search engine — Phase 5
- Multi-region deployment (Ghana, Kenya) — Phase 5
- Video calls / virtual tours
- Property management / tenant portal
- Insurance or mortgage products
